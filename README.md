# Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers and identify potential issues that may lead to customer dissatisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical customer data including demographics, usage patterns, and churn status. It is stored in the `data` directory and is available in CSV format.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features and created new features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Explored various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Also, performed cross-validation to assess model generalization.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuned hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deployed the best-performing model for churn prediction.



Run the Jupyter notebook `churn_prediction.ipynb` to train models and generate predictions.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, with a precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and F1-score of W%.

## Future Work
- Explore additional features that may improve model performance.
- Experiment with advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks or ensemble methods.
- Implement real-time prediction capabilities for proactive churn management.
