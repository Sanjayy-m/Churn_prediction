## Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection and classification of fruits and vegetables using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the MobileNetV2 architecture. By leveraging the power of deep learning, the model will be able to accurately identify various types of fruits and vegetables from input images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of different fruits and vegetables. It includes various classes such as apples, oranges, bananas, tomatoes, carrots, spinach, etc. The dataset should be organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a different class (e.g., "apple", "orange", "banana", etc.).

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture employed in this project is based on MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNetV2 offers a good balance between model size and accuracy, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

## Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the dataset, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation if necessary. Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the MobileNetV2 architecture. Fine-tune the model on the training set and validate its performance using the validation set. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to improve model accuracy and generalization.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance in real-world scenarios. Measure metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to quantify the model's effectiveness.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for fruit and vegetable detection in practical applications. This could involve integrating the model into a mobile app, web service, or IoT device to provide real-time detection capabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- pandas

## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Organize the dataset into separate directories, with each directory containing images of a single class (fruit or vegetable).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Use preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare the dataset for training.

3. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the provided script or notebook. Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its accuracy and performance metrics.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for fruit and vegetable detection in real-world applications. Integrate the model into your preferred platform or environment for use.
